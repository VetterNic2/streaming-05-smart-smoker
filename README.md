## Module 5: Creating a Producer

Throughout this module, I will create a producer using python and RabbitMQ. 

This will show skills in data streaming and the ability to understand python related to streaming analytics. 

I will also be working with RabbitMQ as a "broker" to successfully produce messages to queues based on criteria. 

I hope you enjoy my project and have a great day!

-Nic
